## Description

_{This application was build using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 3.3.7 JavaScript, and jQuery 3.5.1. The purpose of this project is to create a functional website which allows the user to enter a numerical input. The program will then use the business logic portion of the scripts.js file to process the input and determine if it is valid. If it is, the program will perform various logical checks to determine which response to output to the user. If the user fails to enter the correct input type, the program will continue to prompt them for input until they succeed. }_
